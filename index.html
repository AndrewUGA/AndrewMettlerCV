                About Me
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am planning on graduating in May 2025 with a major in finance, a minor in computer science, and an empahsis in business analytics.
                Following my undergraduate career I am planning on staying at the University of Georgia to pursue my Masters in Science of Business Analytics.
                I see myself as someone who is very analytical, and someone who appreciates how the business world is run. I coupled my major in finance
                with a minor in computer science because I know that as the world develops there will be a much higher desire for thsoe who
                know their way around a computer and database. Additionally, I see myself as someone how has a sharp set of skill wihtin interpersonal
                communications.
